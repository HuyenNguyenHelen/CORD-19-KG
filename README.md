```
precision = tp/(tp+fp)	
recall=tp/(tp+fn)	
F1 =  (2 * Precision * Recall)/Precision + Recall)	
Accuracy = tp/(tp+fn)	
```

where:
- tp: number of terms* that are shared between the correct answer and the prediction.
- fp: number of terms that are in the prediction but not in the correct answer.
- fn: number of terms that are in the correct answer but not in the prediction.
